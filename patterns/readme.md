# Patterns
> A Modern Perspective on Software Architecture

## Definition

- That which serves to be imitated as a model; prototype;
- Model size used to define a unit;
- Typically used in solutions to recurring problems

## Values

In resume, using Patterns is critical to promoting consistency, efficiency, quality, security, and innovation across a wide variety of areas.
They are also essential for facilitating communication, collaboration and interoperability between systems and people.

## Examples

- Learning new language
- Creating a book or a documentation

## Main Patterns

- Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Proxy, Observer, Facade, Adapter, Builder, Module, Hooks, HOC, Container, Prototype, Compound, Mixin)
- Rendering Patterns (CSR, SSR)
- Performance Patterns (Modules, Preload, Prefetch)
- Architectural Patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM)

## Main Problems

- Overengineering
- Rigidity (specific for isolated situations)
- Excessive Complexity
- High Learning Curve
- Initial Overload
- Performance Overhead

To mitigate these problems it is important to carefully consider whether the Design Pattern is appropriate for the problem at hand.

You shouldn't apply a standard just because you think it's right, but after a careful analysis of the project's needs.

It is also important to ensure that developers understand the standards well and apply them appropriately.

## Insights

> A simple way to be a better engineer, enjoy perf benefits, and move faster, is to not over-engineer your code. So many times I see projects suffer is from over-engineering. Really. That's usually the root cause. We need to stop assuming that complexity is tied to intelligence. Smart people keep things as simple as is legible. - Sarah Drasner (Google)

> Keep code simple. Make it easy to read and maintain by others. Design patterns are great, but use them when it's clear they add value. Break everything down into simple ideas. Keep code clear, concise and to the point. Your team will appreciate the clarity this can add. - Addy Osmani (Google)

## Principe

> KISS Principe - “Keep It Short and Simple” or “Keep It Simple, Stupid”

The acronym was supposedly coined by Kelly Johnson, an aeronautical engineer with the challenge of designing a plane that should be repairable by an average mechanic on the battlefield and in combat conditions, just with simple tools.

The term “stupid” refers to the relationship between the way of how things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many military personnel of the USA, especially the Navy and Air Force, and mainly in software development.

## Tips

- House Structure

The end user doesn't care how smart something is created. They care about being able to enjoy the result of what was created and make it useful for your own lives. When you have a simple explanation and a simple product, more likely the result will be useful to other people.

That's all, folks! Thanks.
